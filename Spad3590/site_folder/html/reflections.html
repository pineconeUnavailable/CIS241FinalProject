        <b>Takeaway 1: Ask for help</b>
        <p>
            The most important thing that I learned in this class is probably that reaching out for help when you need it is essential. <br>
            Before this class I was relatively adverse to reaching out for help when I needed it, but in this class I had so many computer problems, network issues, and just flat weird stuff happen that going forward purely on my own was impossible. <br>
            In this class I learned that sometimes when you reach out for help and you have no other options, people can be kind and reasonable. <br> 
        </p>

        <br>

        <b>Takeaway 2: Meet basic requirements first</b>
        <p>
            I have a habit of taking assignments in my own direction because I enjoy programming and making. <br>
            Usually, this is fine because if I can take even a tiny bit of artistic license on a project I can enjoy working on it and I have plenty of motivation to work on it. <br>
            However, this becomes a problem when I only have just enough time to meet the requirements. <br>
            In this class, everything was step-by-step which took away some of that control and a little bit of the enjoyment with it. <br>
            Now, I always try my best to meet requirements first and only take my own liberties when I think it is very important. <br>
            <span class="splurge">Its not like I don't still make <em> some </em> exceptions on my own time though <em>(see background)</em>.</span>
